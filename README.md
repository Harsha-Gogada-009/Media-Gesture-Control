# Media-Gesture-Control
A computer vision project using Pytorch , YOLOv8 and MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition to control Media Player.

# ðŸŽ¯ Gesture-Based Media Player Controller

This project enables users to control **VLC Media Player** using **hand gestures** in real-time. It integrates **YOLOv8** (for hand detection) and **MediaPipe** (for precise hand tracking), with **PyTorch optimizations** for improved performance.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** detects hands in the video stream.
- **MediaPipe** extracts hand landmarks to analyze finger positions.
- Gestures are classified based on landmark positions.
- **PyTorch optimizations** enhance real-time processing.
- **PyAutoGUI** sends keyboard shortcuts to VLC based on detected gestures.
